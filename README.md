# Blood Donors Management System (bdms)
Sample app using ArcGIS mapping platform with ESRI maps, Angular2 and Socket.io 

This application would allow patients to search for blood donors near them or search in the world map for a specif location, the patient can see the donors information, also any possible donor can search for it's location and by clicking on the map fill a form with his/her data in order to become a donor.

Application changed to use Webpack for module loading (as loading ESRI modules with SystemJS as of today does not work totally well and is really difficult to accomplish with SystemJS).
